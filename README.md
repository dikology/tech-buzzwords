# What is Anki? ![Anki](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Anki-icon.svg)

Anki is a program which makes remembering things easy.[^1]

- uses [Spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition), which means you don't have to **decide** which cards to review
- available on multiple platforms with cloud sync

## Desktop Version
Anki is available on several platforms but the desktop version is the most complete and offers every feature.

> Though I use it only for editing my decks. Most of the time I use the mobile version for learning.

## Download & Install
Start by [downloading the version that corresponds to your operating system (PC, Mac or Linux) from here](https://apps.ankiweb.net/). Then, install and run it.

> Again, if you're planning on just using the deck from this repo, just find and download it from AppStore or Google Play

# My Shared Deck

Installation is easy. Download a deck from this repo and double-click or open it to have it added. These decks can be further customized to your liking after importing them.

## Synchronisation
Once you’re done adding notes or importing decks, click the Sync button in the top bar on the main screen. If you weren’t already prompted to log in or sign up when starting up Anki, you will be now. Your account on AnkiWeb is used to synchronize your cards and their associated media files (pictures and audio) across all your devices through cloud storage.

# Learning on Mobile

Though you can view your cards on a desktop as well, it’s more convenient and flexible to do so on your phone. You have the freedom to pull out your Anki deck whenever and wherever you want since cards are downloaded and can be accessed offline.

## AnkiDroid

AnkiDroid is a free open-source Android app for using Anki. It’s more capable than you’d expect for a mobile companion app. Among other things, it allows you to import shared decks and add, delete and modify notes. You can rely on just this app if you plan to use shared decks without any modifications.

## AnkiMobile
AnkiMobile is the iOS counterpart of AnkiDroid. 

Unlike the Android version, AnkiMobile is a paid app. 

## Synchronisation
To get all cards you added, you’ll have to synchronize first. Click the circular sync icon in the top right corner and you’ll be prompted to sign in with your AnkiWeb account.

The AnkiDroid app doesn’t synchronize automatically when opening or closing the app in the same way that the desktop client does. This means you’ll need to remember to sync by clicking the icon to receive new cards you’ve added, or to update your progress.
